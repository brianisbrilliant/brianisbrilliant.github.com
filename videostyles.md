# Video Styles
###### by Brian Foster for Boot Up Camp 2020

### Description
Video has more to offer written text with the addition of vocal inflections and body language. This session is for anyone interested in (or required to) have a video presence and will cover how to make the most with the tools you have at hand. We may walk outside or near a window. We will explore some programs. There will be actionable tips (this is *not* a theory session) so you should be ready to take notes!
