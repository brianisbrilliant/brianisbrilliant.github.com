# **ICT Game Jam**

Hello and welcome to the 11th ICT Game Jam! We are so glad that you are here. The ICT Game Jam is an event where participants are tasked with creating a game in a weekend!

||Schedule||
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Friday Feb 5th|Saturday Feb 6th|Sunday Feb 7th|
|Kickoff at 7pm|Work all day!|Finish at noon!|

## How to Jam

Is this your first jam? Is it your hundredth? Either way, we've got [loads of tips and tricks](http://ictgamejam.com/guide) for you.

## Slack Channel

We will be talking in the #gamedev channel of the devICT slack, [get an invite here](https://devict-slackin.herokuapp.com/). Participants will be sharing screenshots, asking and answering questions, and posting tips to free assets, tutorials, and more. That's where the party is, you should be there!

## Theme
To be announced on July 25th! Submit ideas for the theme here.

We realize this isn't ideal, but we also did not want to entirely skip 2020, so here are the details!


## Details

- The Jam will last a week instead of two days.
- There will be no entrance fee
- There will be no community vote or community vote prize
- There will be a $100 prize for the winning team
- The winner will be chosen by a vote of the developer teams. One vote per team, much like the developer vote done at the last two jams.
- Because the event is online, you will be required to submit your game online to itch.io for judging and to be eligible for the prize money.

## Preparation

One thing you might go ahead and do is learn how to export games from your favorite game engine in a way that most people can play them. Web exports work well for anybody to play.

## Questions

1. Will there be t-shirts?
Maybe? If enough of you want them, and we get the graphics together,  we will put together an order after the Jam.
2. Will there be stickers?
Hopefully! We are working on the graphics and an order.
