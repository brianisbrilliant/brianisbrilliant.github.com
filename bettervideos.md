# Better Videos for Instruction
###### by Brian Foster for IDD Fall 2019

### Description
If you are dissatisfied with attempts to add video to your Canvas shells for lecture, for announcements, for introductions, and more - join me for an explanation of why some videos look and sound better than others. I will answer questions! I will demonstrate in-person. We will practice each step of the production - from shooting, to trimming or editing, to uploading and posting to Canvas.
