# Better Videos for Instruction
###### by Brian Foster for IDD Fall 2019

### Description
If you are dissatisfied with attempts to add video to your Canvas shells for lecture, for announcements, for introductions, and more - join me for an explanation of why some videos look and sound better than others. I will answer questions! I will demonstrate in-person. We will practice each step of the production - from shooting, to trimming or editing, to uploading and posting to Canvas.

### Prep

Here are some things that I want to talk about tomorrow.
- Put the camera between you and the brightest light source.
- The more light there is, the less grainy of an image you get, and often the better frame rate that you get.
- You can upload directly to YouTube from your phone, either iOS or Android.
- Both iOS and Android have easy ways to trim your videos.
- Lapel mics are wonderful, but your iPhone gets great audio too!
- Zoom is a wonderful tool for screen capture as well as meeting with students, and I should **definitely** show it off tomorrow.
- Can you post to canvas from your phone?
