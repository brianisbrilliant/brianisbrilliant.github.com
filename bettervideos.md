# Better Videos for Instruction
###### by Brian Foster for IDD Fall 2019

### Description
If you are dissatisfied with attempts to add video to your Canvas shells for lecture, for announcements, for introductions, and more - join me for an explanation of why some videos look and sound better than others. I will answer questions! I will demonstrate in-person. We will practice each step of the production - from shooting, to trimming or editing, to uploading and posting to Canvas.

### Prep

Here are some things that I want to talk about tomorrow.
- Put the camera between you and the brightest light source.
- The more light there is, the less grainy of an image you get, and often the better frame rate that you get.
- You can upload directly to YouTube from your phone, either iOS or Android.
- Both iOS and Android have easy ways to trim your videos.
- Lapel mics are wonderful, but your iPhone gets great audio too!
- Zoom is a wonderful tool for screen capture as well as meeting with students, and I should **definitely** show it off tomorrow.
- Can you post to canvas from your phone? Absolutely you can, but it is a terrible experience!!!
- So, the YouTube app will let you record directly from your phone, trim it, add effects, and then upload it. It will let you set it as unlisted so that it isn't publicly visible. Then, you can look at the video, click Share, then paste the link as a new link in an announcement or assignment. *I think this is the best option for us.*
- I definitely want to talk about my methods, how I set my videos up.
- I want to talk about Epic Pen and OBS.
